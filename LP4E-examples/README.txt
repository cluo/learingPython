This is the distribution package for source-code examples in the book 
Learning Python 4th Edition (September, 2009).

Here, you will find one text file per book chapter, containing all the 
source code in that chapter.
  
Almost all the code in this book is short code snippets shown running 
at the interactive prompt, rather than named source files.  Because of 
that, all the code in a chapter is collected in a single file, whether
it is run interactively or not.  If a code section is listed as a file 
in the book, its name is given in the chapter file as a comment line 
of this form:

### file: spam.py

Cut and paste its code from the chapter's text file into a text editor
to save as a separate file on your computer.

These files may work best when used sequentially, in parallel with the 
book itself.  To find specific code at random, try a text search within
the chapter's file.
